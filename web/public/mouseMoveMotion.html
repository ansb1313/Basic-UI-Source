                                <p>Once the message is sent it can’t be changed neither by the user or the recipient.
                                    But sometimes we desperately want to add something on top of what’s written. Or you
                                    may simply want to delete the capsule before it will be unlocked.</p>
                                <p>In such cases, you’ll be required to make an In-App Purchase. The payment will be
                                    required if you want to send two messages to one recipient. Because, well...
                                    everyone should pay the price to influence the course of time.</p>
